<h2>DevOps Tutorial for Beginners to Advance 2025 - The Techzeen</h2>
DevOps Learning Roadmap: Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS on Linux
Welcome to your DevOps journey! This README provides a focused roadmap for mastering Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, all within a Linux operating system environment. It’s designed for beginners with basic Linux skills, guiding you through practical steps, tools, and best practices to become proficient in DevOps. The roadmap is structured in stages, with each stage building on the previous one, and includes hands-on tasks to solidify your learning.
Why Linux for DevOps?
Linux is the backbone of modern DevOps due to its flexibility, open-source nature, and widespread use in servers, cloud environments, and DevOps tools. Most production systems (e.g., AWS EC2 instances) run Linux, making it essential for DevOps practitioners. This guide assumes you’re using a Linux distribution like Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or similar, e.g., Debian, CentOS) for all tasks.
Prerequisites

A Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu installed on a PC, VM, or WSL2 on Windows).
Basic Linux commands: ls, cd, mkdir, apt (or yum), sudo, nano/vim.
Internet access for installing tools and accessing GitHub/AWS.
An AWS free-tier account (sign up at aws.amazon.com).
A GitHub account (sign up at github.com).

DevOps Roadmap
This roadmap is divided into three stages: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each stage focuses on specific tools and skills, with practical tasks to apply your knowledge. Time estimates assume 5-10 hours of study per week.
Stage 1: Beginner (Foundations – Git, GitHub, and Linux Basics)
Goal: Master version control with Git/GitHub and solidify Linux skills.Duration: 4-6 weeks.
1.1 Learn Linux Basics

Why: Linux is the OS for DevOps tools and cloud servers. You’ll use it for everything from installing tools to managing containers.
Key Skills:
File system navigation: ls, cd, pwd, find.
File manipulation: touch, cp, mv, rm, cat, less.
Package management: apt update, apt install (Ubuntu) or yum (CentOS).
Permissions: chmod, chown, sudo.
Processes: ps, top, kill.
Shell scripting: Write simple Bash scripts (e.g., automate file backups).


Tasks:
Install Ubuntu 22.04 (or equivalent) on a VM (e.g., VirtualBox) or use WSL2.
Practice commands: Create a directory (mkdir my_project), copy files (cp), and change permissions (chmod 755 script.sh).
Write a Bash script to list all .txt files in a directory and save it as list_files.sh.
Install Git: sudo apt install git (Ubuntu) or sudo yum install git (CentOS).

1.2 Master Git and GitHub

Why: Git is the standard for version control, and GitHub is the platform for collaboration and hosting code.
Key Skills:
Git commands: git init, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git branch, git merge.
GitHub workflows: Create repositories, fork, clone, pull requests.
Resolving merge conflicts.


Tasks:
Configure Git: git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com".
Create a GitHub repository and push a sample project (e.g., a simple README.md or Python script).
Practice branching: Create a feature branch (git branch feature-x), make changes, and merge it (git merge).
Fork an open-source repo on GitHub, clone it locally (git clone), and submit a pull request with a small change.

Stage 2: Intermediate (CI/CD and Containers – Jenkins, Docker, and AWS)
Goal: Build automated pipelines with Jenkins, containerize apps with Docker, and deploy on AWS.Duration: 2-4 months.
2.1 Jenkins for CI/CD

Why: Jenkins automates building, testing, and deploying code, forming the backbone of CI/CD pipelines.
Key Skills:
Install and configure Jenkins on Linux.
Create pipelines using Jenkinsfile (declarative or scripted).
Integrate Jenkins with GitHub for automated builds.


Tasks:
Install Jenkins on Ubuntu:sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins


Access Jenkins at http://localhost:8080, unlock it using the initial admin password (sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword), and install suggested plugins.
Create a pipeline job that pulls code from a GitHub repo, runs tests (e.g., for a Python app), and builds it.
Set up a GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins builds on code pushes.


Resources:
Jenkins official documentation (jenkins.io/doc).
Course: Udemy’s “Jenkins, From Zero to Hero”.



2.2 Docker for Containerization

Why: Docker packages applications into portable containers, ensuring consistency across environments.
Key Skills:
Docker concepts: Images, containers, Dockerfile, Docker Hub.
Build and run containers on Linux.
Integrate Docker with Jenkins for CI/CD.


Tasks:
Install Docker on Ubuntu:sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER


Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js or Python app (e.g., a Flask web server).
Build and run: docker build -t my-app . and docker run -p 5000:5000 my-app.
Push the image to Docker Hub: docker push yourusername/my-app.
Update your Jenkins pipeline to build and test a Docker image.

Deploy apps on EC2 using Linux instances.
Use AWS CLI for automation.


Tasks:
Install AWS CLI on Linux:curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws configure


Launch an EC2 instance (Ubuntu, free tier), SSH into it (ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@ec2-ip), and deploy a Dockerized app.
Store app artifacts (e.g., logs) in an S3 bucket.
Automate EC2 deployment in your Jenkins pipeline using AWS CLI commands.

sudo install kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl


Deploy a sample app: Create a Deployment (kubectl create deployment my-app --image=yourusername/my-app) and expose it (kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort --port=5000).
Scale the app: kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3.
Integrate Kubernetes with Jenkins for automated deployments.

Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation.
Monitor apps with AWS CloudWatch.


Tasks:
Set up an EKS cluster using eksctl:curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-east-1


Deploy your Dockerized app to EKS.

Best Practices

Linux Security: Use ufw for firewalls, update packages regularly (sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade), and manage SSH keys securely.
Git Workflow: Adopt GitFlow or trunk-based development for team collaboration.
CI/CD: Keep pipelines simple, test-driven, and idempotent.
Docker: Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size; avoid running containers as root.
Kubernetes: Use namespaces for organization, RBAC for security, and Helm for package management.
AWS: Follow the Well-Architected Framework; use IAM roles, not access keys, for automation.
Backup Learning: Document your setups in GitHub READMEs and practice recovery scenarios.

Sample Project
To tie everything together:

Create a Python Flask app and host its code on GitHub.
Set up a Jenkins pipeline to build and test the app, then create a Docker image.
Push the image to Docker Hub.
Deploy the app to an AWS EC2 instance or EKS cluster.
Monitor the app with CloudWatch and expose it via a Kubernetes Service.
